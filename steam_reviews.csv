;i hate this game;Recommended;13;13.5;
;This game is literally so ass. The only satisfaction you get is beating strong people. But you don't face anyone with skill. It's either spammers or runners. And i don't understand how it does it but i believe it throws in a couple bots with skins and good borders to make it seem like they're real people. So after a lost streak it'll take 'pity' on you with an easy win. Except it's so easy it doesn't even motivate you to keep playing. It just makes you feel bad because you've lost to a queen nai who thinks their good despite the fact there heavy button is probably eroding from overuse.Not only this but the game also chooses favourites. Speaking from someone who has been a valhallan for multiple seasons i've seen multiple people use the exact same tech's that i use but the only difference is when they use it. It actually works. but when i use it it does that dumb thing where it shows it hit and then they don't actually get hit. It's like trying to fight a ghost that copies you.It can attack you just fine but cuz it's a ghost your attacks aren't connecting cuz every ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• player who is about to get combo'd turns ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• intangible;Not Recommended;942;236.4;

;"Brawlhalla has good mechanics and all, but it just seems like a lot is missing from the game. Fighting games are not really my thing anyway, although Brawlhalla has me interested at times, but not enough that I invest hundreds of hours in-game grindimg. They'll definitely have to step up on events and new maps. I mean, I don't think anybody asked for a ""Borderlands"" crossover. Totally lame. Instead they should try something that actually draws the regular person in. A ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" crossover idea isn't far-fetched at all, and it would be way better for the game in my opinion.The maps are just kinda bland. Some of them actually aren't too bad, but there's nothing besides different themes to spice it up a bit. Combat would be so much more immersive if you were also fighting against the platforms, and not just your opponents.Game will run smoothly on almost any machine, and at a high FPS too, which is brilliant, but good performance can't save Brawlhalla from what it is: a flawed game all around. It is interesting, mind you, but eventually that interest fades...Don't particularly recommend, but keep an open mind and don't take my opinion into account too much. Try the game for yourself if you'd like üëç";Not Recommended;1015;23.6;

;very fun to play with friends, i have a love hate relationship with this game... i love the fact they added cross progression and cross play between all devices, makes the game way more enjoyable and convenient for the players. the things i DONT like is that the game is so damn boring without the full version, you only get 9 characters to play from but with the full version you get around 60 and the dlc characters are way better than the base ones so its pay to win in a way. also the crossover legends are very expensive if you buy a lot of them. some of the maps are absolute ass because they're trap dependent so all you have to do is spam the traps on that map and you win. last thing i want to point out is that this game is VERY meta based and VERY competitive so if you aren't into that than this game isn't what you're looking for.;Recommended;678;11.7;

;"I do not like playing this game most of the time. It has its moments, but it's just not that good. The amount of crossovers and grindiness for each character is extremely annoying. I somewhat understand drip-feeding new characters/fighters to the player, but as someone who only plays this game occasionally, and I'm not very good at it, I know that I will not unlock most characters ever unless I empty my wallet for it. The characters are all somewhat balanced, but what if I want to try a different playstyle? And also, there are some characters that are much stronger than others.The fighting isn't bad but it has a couple things that are extremely overpowered. I've never been the type who likes fighting games, but this one just isn't it, either.At the end of the day, if you want a fighting game that is quick and free, then get this and try it out. But I'm not going to sink hundreds of hours into a game that I don't enjoy to unlock a few new characters.Tl;dr: Unless you want to sink a lot of time into this game, or just really like fighting games, don't bother. To get new characters with different mechanics besides the first few that are already unlocked, you have to either play a TON or pay. Fighting doesn't feel the best and the game is hard to get into, unless you are really good at fighting games. And if you are good at fighting games, then there are much better ones out there.";Not Recommended;1143;5.3;

;i use to call this game a smash bros clone all the time.....and well that hasn't changed... but its hard to deny that the game over time has became its own little package with some ideas for this genre that i really enjoy, for example. weapon throwing is almost crucial in this game and gives players another tool in the belt rather as a quick defense or a short attack to gain frame advantage. i think this is really cool and can feel awesome to pull off, almost as awesome as platform spawning. this mechanic is probably my favorite letting you create ground no matter where you are in the air, this adds so much air control to the combat being able to choose between basic air attacks and ground attacks in the air on the fly.It should also be said that the items that can drop randomly throughout the match are super fun too never feeling to one sided when someone gets one. i lastly wanna state that the speed of this game is unmatched by other platform fighters frequently feeling like a DBZ fight the way fighters flicker around the stage. all in all brawlhalla isn't a bad game is what i wanna say, it can seriously get you hyped up and having fun and that for sure stands true when playing with a buddy but i feel that brawlhalla when pitted against its other counter parts does not have enough staying power to truly stick with you the way i feel smash bros or even brawl stars 2 can with the much snappier attacks and movement, better dodging, grabs, and unique fighters with their own move sets (brawlhalla characters share weapons between each other meaning if you can learn sword combos then you can use any sword character with no changes in moves other than special abilitys). im sure i am just overthinking this free game but brawlhalla gives me alot of mixed signals its fun but its missing something 5/10;Recommended;1490;145.7;

;I picked up the game because of the Mega Man crossover and played a tiny bit with a random character and had a decent time. The controls felt a bit weird (I'd rebind them if I play more), and half the time it felt like I had no idea what I was doing (which is fair since I just started playing).Not a fan of crossover characters costing so much- 400 of the premium currency doesn't sound too bad until you realize there's no good way to get exactly 400- you'd need both the cheapest $6 pack and the next $13 pack to have enough, or just simply get the $20 pack since that will give you slightly more. Spending $20 on one character (which is technically a skin with new sound effects) is kind of crazy if you ask me. I was excited to try the game during the crossover but seeing that sort of pricing is making me wanna steer clear admittedly.;Not Recommended;679;0.4;

Nope play TF2 or just use hammer and axe. want balanced mechanics? nope sig spam will be in almost any rank because of you play the right characters they are unironically unpunishable after their heaviest attack.

;I personally rate this game 9.2/10. I wrote down some bullet points and gave it to an AI to put it into words for me.Brawlhalla Review: A Love Letter to Competitive MayhemBrawlhalla, developed by Blue Mammoth Games, is a game that doesn‚Äôt just live in the shadow of platform fighters‚Äîit shines as a star of its own, thriving on chaos, competitive intensity, and pure fun. As a free-to-play platform fighter, it offers a vast range of characters, stages, and modes, ensuring that no match feels quite the same. It's the kind of game that pulls you in with simple mechanics, yet keeps you hooked with a deep, ever-evolving skill ceiling. Having played this game extensively and rated it a 9.2/10, I can wholeheartedly say Brawlhalla is an absolute joy to dive into.Gameplay: Pure Competitive BlissAt the heart of Brawlhalla lies its easy-to-learn, hard-to-master gameplay. Newcomers are quickly acquainted with its mechanics‚Äîjumping, dodging, light and heavy attacks‚Äîbut the depth is revealed once you face more skilled opponents. The controls are fluid, allowing for precision movement and combos, while still retaining a sense of wild unpredictability. It‚Äôs the kind of game where you can be bouncing around one minute, then find yourself hurtling off the map from an unexpected aerial combo the next. This frenetic pace is what makes Brawlhalla so exhilarating.The game's roster is as diverse as it is impressive. With over 50 Legends to choose from, each equipped with unique stats, weapon combinations, and abilities, the diversity of playstyles on offer is staggering. Whether you prefer brawling up close with fists or controlling space with long-range attacks, Brawlhalla has a Legend that suits your style. And the regular updates mean that no matter how much time you put into the game, there‚Äôs always something new to discover and master.Art Style and Presentation: Vibrant ChaosVisually, Brawlhalla is a colorful, energetic masterpiece. Its art style embraces the cartoonish side of its platform fighter roots, with vibrant backgrounds and character designs that feel both playful and distinct. Each Legend has a personality of their own, conveyed through their animations, skins, and taunts, making every fight feel like a battle between distinct personalities rather than just avatars.The stages are designed with chaos in mind, featuring dynamic platforms, hazards, and environmental obstacles that keep you on your toes. It‚Äôs not just about outmaneuvering your opponents but also mastering the stage itself, which adds another layer of depth to each fight.The simplicity of the art style doesn‚Äôt take away from the impact of the fights. In fact, it makes the hits feel more satisfying, with every knockout being punctuated by vibrant explosions and sound effects that make your victory (or defeat) all the more intense.Player Experience: Perfect for Casuals and Competitives AlikeOne of the best aspects of Brawlhalla is its accessibility. Whether you‚Äôre hopping in for a quick, casual game with friends or grinding ranked mode to climb the competitive ladder, Brawlhalla offers a seamless experience for all types of players. Its cross-platform play means you can brawl with friends no matter what system they're on, and its free-to-play model ensures that anyone can jump in without any financial barrier.Despite its simplicity on the surface, Brawlhalla is surprisingly deep. The weapon system is one of the game‚Äôs standout features. Each Legend can wield two distinct weapons, and mastering the moveset of each one is critical to success. The balance between the weapons‚Äîbe it the graceful swordplay or the brute force of a hammer‚Äîkeeps each match dynamic and exciting. Add in dodging, edge-guarding, and juggling opponents in the air, and you have a game that rewards both technical prowess and creativity.For the competitive-minded, the ranked mode is where the game truly shines. Each victory feels earned, and each loss a lesson. There's a real sense of progression as you improve, sharpen your strategies, and climb through the ranks. It‚Äôs not uncommon to find yourself lost in hours of matches, driven by the desire to outsmart and outfight your opponents. The satisfaction of landing a well-timed combo or a perfectly executed knockout is simply unparalleled.A Community-Driven GameOne of the reasons Brawlhalla feels so alive is its thriving community. The game boasts a strong online presence, with regular tournaments, events, and collaborations that keep players engaged. The devs actively listen to the community, with frequent balance patches and updates that ensure the game stays fresh and competitive. The presence of special event modes and crossovers with popular franchises only add to the game's appeal, bringing in iconic characters from Adventure Time, WWE, Shovel Knight, and more. These collaborations are more than just marketing ploys‚Äîthey seamlessly integrate into the game and provide a sense of playful excitement.The cosmetic options, while purely aesthetic, allow for endless customization. Whether you're decking out your favorite Legend in an exclusive skin or showing off with new animations and taunts, the game allows players to express their individuality.The Love for BrawlhallaAs someone who rates Brawlhalla a solid 9.2/10, my love for the game stems from the fact that it manages to hit the perfect balance between fun and challenge. Few games can evoke the kind of adrenaline-pumping excitement that Brawlhalla delivers. It‚Äôs a game that‚Äôs easy to jump into, yet rich enough to sink hundreds of hours into without growing stale. Every match is different, every opponent a new challenge, and every victory a cause for celebration.The thing that sets Brawlhalla apart is that it doesn‚Äôt just appeal to competitive players‚Äîit welcomes everyone. Whether you're playing solo, with friends, or diving into an all-out free-for-all with randoms, the game is consistently enjoyable. It‚Äôs lighthearted enough to keep you laughing and thrilling enough to keep you coming back.Final Verdict: 9.2/10Brawlhalla is a triumph in the platform fighter genre. Its blend of accessible mechanics, diverse roster, and frenetic combat creates an experience that is as thrilling for casual players as it is for competitive veterans. The vibrant art style, engaging gameplay, and constant updates ensure that the game stays fresh and fun, no matter how much time you invest. Whether you're brawling with friends, competing in ranked, or just having fun with the variety of game modes, Brawlhalla stands as one of the most enjoyable, satisfying, and outright addictive games in its genre.If you're a fan of chaotic, fast-paced action with a competitive edge, this is a game you won't want to miss.;Recommended;5676;59.8;

;Recipe for pancakes with milkIngredientsflour ‚Äî 200 gmilk ‚Äî 500 mlegg ‚Äî 2 pcs.sunflower oil ‚Äî 3 tbsp. l. saltsugar ‚Äî 1 tsp.1. To make thin pancakes, you will need a blender. Pour milk into his bowl. After that, add sunflower oil, sugar, salt and break the eggs. Next, beat the ingredients with an immersion blender until smooth, avoiding the formation of lumps.2. Pour the dough into a bowl. After that, we take out the frying pan and put it on the fire. Pour sunflower oil on the bottom of the pan and start frying pancakes. To do this, we scoop the dough with a ladle and pour it on the bottom, ensuring an even distribution so that the pancake is smooth and acquires a round shape.3. Fry the pancakes on each side for 3-4 minutes. Then we serve it in portions. If desired, you can sprinkle with sugar, spread with butter or make envelopes or tubes, adding the filling at your discretion. Enjoy your meal!Important notesIf you want to achieve an openwork look, you can replace milk with kefir. This ingredient gives the pastry a very fancy pattern, which is why the pancakes are called lace. In addition, they acquire a pleasant taste with a slightly curd tint. After frying the pancake, grease the bottom of the pan with oil again so that the dough is well baked and does not burn. When kneading a milk-based dough, it is necessary to achieve a consistency similar to kefir. If it turns out to be liquid, then add flour, if thick, then, on the contrary, pour in more milk.Additional recommendationsPancakes with milk are made easier than ever. The pastry turns out delicious, while it is suitable for sweet, vegetable, fish, chicken, mushroom and other fillings. To make the dough more tender according to the step-by-step recipe for thin pancakes, some recommend replacing butter with margarine, while limiting it to one chicken egg. It is advisable to use warmed milk. The more sugar you add to the dough, the rougher the edges turn out. At the same time, the calorie content also increases. If the dough is too thick, it is better to dilute it with water instead of milk. To make the dough homogeneous and without lumps, it is necessary to sift the flour before mixing it. To make pancakes with milk look delicate, it is advised to add a little carbonated water when kneading the dough;Recommended;1886;1.0;

;Addicting if you can react to dodges and string beautiful combos together. Everyone has a playstyle and it's an infinite learning ground on behavioural patterns in fighting games that will translate to any other platform fighter. This is one of the most rewarding games for getting reads and the most punishing games for making blunders.The weapon throw mechanic is the highlight of the gameplay. It's the most important part of the game which can turn tides in an instant against the opponent. Mastering the weapon throw is the way to reach the higher ranks, and the way each weapon varies the weapon throws uses (for example an orb compared to a spear, hurtboxes are comparably different) gives an infinite ability to improve.This is a game that easily can induce flow state and rapidly increase your skill level within a days time, the skill progression in this game is like steps. One day you will take the next step in mechanics such as dash dodging for example, then once that's implemented and practiced for a day it sticks forever. Harder setups require practice which the training grounds in this game does amazing.I've been a majority free to player, I've spent around $5.00 in the game for a kaya skin, and I enjoy the progression of a free to play perspective, it encourages you to try the new champions you buy until you have enough for the next one, which builds mechanics on every weapon and allows you to have fun with everyone in the game, as well as understand how much lag each move has, how to punish your opponents no matter who they are, and so on.10/10;Recommended;1299;448.3;

;"I've logged approximately 600 hours in this game in my main acc, and I believe I have enough experience to provide an informed review for those considering whether or not to dive in.Firstly, the game itself is solid. The variety of legends, skins, weapons, and the fighting mechanics all contribute to a decent experience. However, what severely detracts from this is the community. Ever since I started playing, I've rarely had a session where I felt calm or unbothered. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many combos you master or how fast your gameplay is; there‚Äôs always someone who will spam signatures, relentlessly use light attacks, and taunt by flexing with emotes or other trivial things.I'm 20 years old, and I can confidently say that after a loss, you‚Äôre likely to encounter someone who, despite having minimal experience, will insult you with phrases like ""get better, little bro."" It‚Äôs frustrating, especially when these comments come from players who just recently started the game themselves.In conclusion, while the game has its merits, I strongly advise against installing it if you value your self-esteem and mental health. The toxic community can quickly overshadow any enjoyment the game might offer.";Not Recommended;1015;66.9;

For one, the meta in this game is the worst thing you will probably ever see come out of a videogame, there are way too many OP characters and weapons such as lance, and im getting tired of fighting loki for the 17th time in a row because he's op in lower ranks and the devs only appeal to the pros. Horrible servers as well, and the worst thing about this entire game is the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• player base. Everyone on here talks ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• but is playing the most no skill character. I personally advise to buy a Switch and get super smash bros instead of playing this game. There are no skill little rats that have spent 8k on this game and are sitting in silver/gold lobbies spamming loki. Half of ranking up in this game is praying that you don't go against a lance character or that dumbass turtle that thinks hes master Uogway or however tf you spell it. To the devs please take lance out, im getting tired of perfectly timing dodges just to get a combo that does the same damage as the lance deals in one side special, fix ur game.;Not Recommended;858;63.2;

The devs are working on it, but as it stands, it's very hard for a new player to learn the game without looking stuff up.This causes a lot of people to complain about ""spamming"" (that's most of the negative reviews for this game...) because they don't know how to adapt and counter it.I do not regret starting to play Brawlhalla.

;I've played since beta in 2017, Mordex was the newest legend at the time. It reminded me of super smash bros but not like melee, it was like the original 64 smash. As the game changed over the years with updates like, dashing on stage, removing signature true combos, buffing and nerfing weapons..... the game stayed in a particularly balanced state. Any legend could be and was played at a competitive level, yet the game was easy to pick up a true gem of a fighting game.And then they released greatsword which was trash at launch until players figured out how to use it. I'd say that took a few months until the weapon was insufferable then nerfed into the ground becoming a more niche weapon.Now, the era of battle boots. It was ridiculous at launch, and it still is. I've given it time to get used to, to find some way to out range it, punish it, to no avail. The game has lost it's luster, what once was a true balanced experience is now just another game.If you wanna kick back spam sigs in this smash clone then go ahead. If you're more competitive in nature I would look elsewhere for your fix. Thanks for the good times Brawl.;Not Recommended;926;1369.6;

;"ALright, 1000 hours into the game on pc. Do i recommend this game to anyone? Yes and No.Let me get the bad out of the way:Firstly the game has characters who are misleading and fairly unbalanced even though their stats will tell you otherwise. Stats dont matter until a Legend has less than 5 or more than 8. Most of the legend with 8 or 9 as a base stat are usually the ones that are the scariest and most annoying to deal with and fight against. When you first get into the game, there are a LOT of Sig spammers and toxic gold players who will hit a slightly cool combo on you (being a new player and not knowing anything) and then will try to taunt and flex on you as if you were their equal. One thing that people often talk about it how all the characters are basically the same because its just the same weapons with different special moves. And unfortunately that is true. There aren't many characters that are unique (unless its been the last 6 legends) nor do they have anything that makes them stand out more than others. Not just that but the balance patches (not including the most recent one) have been 25/25/50. Sometimes its a great patch with some good changes or a mediocre patch with some nothing burger changes or its a terrible patch that can break legends or weapons to the point that every is abusing it. Not all patches are bad but most of them usually dont do much good for the game. You also have the community. Imma be straight up, this community sucks. The people are either degenerates or toxic as all hell to the point that it carrys over to any other games you might play with someone from said community. If anything, try to stay far away from the community unless you're also a degenerate and what not. Another thing that sucks and is a very big reason i try to keep people away from the game is Ranked. Ranked is a garbage cesspool of Smurfs and Diamond who purposefully get knocked down to lower ranks like bronze, tin, silver or gold to bully newer players who wanna rank up or even seasoned players who are trying to get better at the game but can't because someone just hit them a bunch and they couldn't move. Rank doesn't truly matter in this game too. I've fought plenty of people who have the diamond border but still lose to me with ease as a gold/plat player.Now the good:So Firstly i want to talk about the game modes. while there may not be many things you can do with the Legends when you're fighting your friends, there are other game modes that can spice things up or make things more fun with the most notable game modes being Morph, Kung Foot, Beach Brawl and Crew Battle. Tbh Morph is probably the only game mode i'd recommend to anyone especially if you're someone who is coming from a traditional fighter or from a more combo heavy game. Kung Foot is literally just soccer but more chaotic and with a lot of silly and fun moments that can come from it and its probably one of the more underrated game modes (but brawlhalla players dont have friends so that could also be why no one really plays or talks about how fun the mode is.) Beach Brawls is the same as Kung Foot and Crew Battle is pretty much super fair 1v1's. These game modes are probably what you would want to play once you've committed to playing brawlhalla more often. Another good thing about the game is the Legends and their sigs and their stats. i know i said in the text above that characters with 8 or 9 as a base stat are usually annoying to deal with, but playing as them on the other hand makes you into a fiend that is pretty unstoppable. Certain characters who have 9 dexterity on weapons like Katars, Hammer or Lance are the most fun to play since you can move a lot faster after whiffing or even hitting someone than any other character with maybe 5 or 6 dexterity. Other characters with 9 Attack or Defense that have Axe (it literally just got nerfed tho) or Greatsword are also very fun to play since you can live through a lot or beat people up and destroy them in 5-7 hits. Its a problem yes but only when its not happening to you. Another great thing about this game is the movement. There are so many options you have to move and maneuver around maps. 5 Jumps and air dodge and a recovery. Some weapons have special aerials that can help you too such as Cannon and Lance with Side Air and even some Sigs allow you to pretty much teleport around the map and out play your opponent or set you up to hit your opponent but that comes with time.TL;DR: Should you play this game? Yes and No. If you want a game that will let you move around and smack around your opponent while also trying to get past all the BS your opponent might be doing then got for it, but if you prefer a more combo heavy game with attacks that link into eachother, dont play this game. Go play rivals atp or wait for Combo DevilsTHE GAME IS FUN JUST STOP TAKING ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• SO SERIOUSLY AND JUST DO RANDOM CRAP AND THEN YOU'LL ENJOY THE GAME";Recommended;4006;1119.8;

;Honest review after 5 years of playing this game:If you're looking to have some fun with some friends and play casually, this is probably one of the best games you can play. Grind that gold to unlock the characters with your friends, get some good laughs with ridiculous gadgets and overall just a good time with friends.This game is beginner friendly, avoid 1v1 online and you'll all be fine.Simple enough to have fun spamming sigs, and easy enough to learn how to not get punished constantly.Now, when it comes to playing more hours and really getting into the game.This is not a casual game at all. Don't expect to be really good unless you spend time learning the weapons, spacing, combos, and most importantly movement and how to read your opponent. On the surface this is a very simple game, but when looked at it in depth, it's just so challenging to become good. If you are playing 2v2s, you have to learn to combo with your team mate.The game also suffers from massive issues when it comes to lagging and bad connection issues. (You can see it all over every single forum talking about the game) And the other main issue is that sometimes developers might readjust weapons and make them absolutely over-powered. There is a lot of toxicity in the game, but you also find pretty good people to enjoy a good brawl sesh.If I had to change something about the game is definitely the lag issues, but if you don't get those, this is definitely a good time.;Recommended;1198;2417.5;

The game is way too competitive so stay far away from it. Im too deep so all i can do is try my best to stop others from playing because i mean if everyone is lagging ONLY when they lose. This game has ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• servers then right? so dont waste your time trying to be good at the game when u will just lag whenever u gonna lose.IF you are one of the people who lag ONLY when you lose.‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• YOUGet goodnerf axecannon is boostedDont play this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• if you dont like butt stuff;Recommended;588;1209.7;

If you're not competitive I suggest doing that because it can be super fun. It's hard to learn though ngl.

;Although it's a great game, it starts to become very VERY repetitive. There's apparently not much to do. The developers add tons of skins and other types of cosmetics more often now. The balance patches have become very rare. New legends and battle passes aren't cool or fun anymore. People only play these kind of games just to experience the gameplay, not to be bombarded with tons of cosmetic items, people don't really care much for cosmetics to be honest.

The game is similar to super smash brothers where you select a character and beat up your opponents in multiple different game modes. Its fun casually. But to do well in online ranked modes you better have good internet connection or something. From my experience, some of my attacks ""hit"" my opponent (I get an audio cue telling me my attack hit), but they continue as if they weren't hit. Sometimes my attacks hit, and my opponent suffers only reduced knockback. Sometimes my opponents are able to execute an incredible number of actions right before my eyes, yet when I input a string of commands, there is just insane lag, like my character is moving through thick syrup lol.

;"!!!!!!!!!Love this game with all my heart!!!!!!!!Ive broken 3 of my moniters, 4 controllers and 1 realationship (she said i couldnt get mad at a game)Used all my money to by a Battlepass that is imposible to get done.I would like to share my deepest feeling for all the Scyth player, Mordex Sweats, Loki snake spammers, guns light attack, bow player..... basically every player that has touched this game. Please wash your hands so you can get a better grip to tie a knot for the rope you going to hang your self with.Honorable mention to all my family members that has sacrificed their mental state for my calmly gaming sesions. (none has died).I love doing challenges such as; dont scream at the topp of your lungs to your grandmas face after getting comboed by a fagh Mordex thats is stroking their Scyth for 100 Gold ,or the Daily; try not to hit you girlfriend challenge for 250 Gold,(A game for someone that has 3 controllers laying around!)(playing with mouse = no friends)";Recommended;808;44.0;
;Perfect if you want 5 broken controllers, depression, wanting to unalive your self, no friends, no social life.Personal advice: Whatever you do DONT thundercunt the controller at your girlfriends face when you get 20-string comboed by a lvl 50 Nix, or sig spammed by a brainless greasy no life loki player.Also some more advice before you spend 9.99$ on the battlepass or 25$ on the deluxe as i did you should probably have about 500 hours on the game so you know how to do the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• impossible insane battlepass challenges that need insane amount of skill and research to perform and execute the challenges with pristine and accurate movements to just get 6 gems and having to instead play ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• 1000 games to just get the gems 2 at a time by grinding xp.9/11 game would recommend! :);Recommended;651;64.0;

;"Video review:YouTube‚Ñ¢ Video: Brawlhalla - Game Review Views: 231https://discord.gg/Yxv7RBJsuk https://linktr.ee/Rainiure #rainiure #movies #gamingBrawlhalla is a fast paced two dimensional fighter game. It features good game play but the skin and design elements surrounding it don't really interest me enough to become a long term fan.Pick from over 65 different Legends to play as. Then you can pick a game mode ranging from a simple 1v1 to a chaotic four player free for all. Once in-game you start with just your bare fists, so be on the lookout for power ups to fall from the sky so you can get equipped with your Legend's weapon types. Deal damage to your opponent to soften them up, then try to deal one big blow to knock them out of the arena.Brawlhalla features a fun and satisfying gameplay loop. I feel like my personal skill is actively improving with each match and my own contribution when playing on a team is very significant. There is a huge roster of Legends to choose from. There is some interesting crossover content with ""Star Wars,"" ""Halo,"" ""Assassin's Creed,"" ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"" ""SpongeBob SquarePants,"" and more.Where the game loses me is how cheap it feels. The art style is not for me at all, and there is plenty of mobile game tactics here. It even goes as far as giving you some free to play currency for watching ad videos inside the game client. Character unlocks are very slow and the game honestly demands too much time to get anywhere within the natural progression.Brawlhalla is well made and is worth giving a try since it's free to play, but it's not really my cup of tea. I personally prefer ""MultiVersus"" to this one even if that is unpopular.5/10.";Recommended;1409;8.7;

But hey thats just my opinion, play this game and you'll get addicted, so far i have 1.8k hours on this game and have nothing productive to show for it. Ranked gives u mental health issues, and sometimes u hop on knowing you don't enjoy the game yet still play it anyways.

;"I have a love relationship with brawlhallaThis game is awesome. From the animations to the crossovers and how quick the balance thingsFirst of all I have to start with the crossovers, as of right now they have so many crossovers to choose, with reasonable prices, I can feel the hard work they put into this characters as they want to sell big. Just 2 weeks ago I bought a sponge bob one of the many crossover characters, and I just have to say the animations and everything is exquisite I loved it a lot. As a small animator myself I love how animated and goofy they make the charactersI also love the fact that this game is a unique and free non p2w version of smash bro's. I have over 1523 hours of smash on switch and I am always looking forward to trying look-alike games. I saw this one on steam with a lot of possible reviews and decided to download it. At first I was meh but then I saw how good the animations and fighting styles where. I loved how balanced you could unlock characters and how balanced they made them. The animations made me feel good with myself, the fact that this is a really good ""Smash bro's copy"" makes me just wanna cry of happiness. A game this good and balanced comes 1 in every 15 years.The balancing is ok. I mean they are quick with working on it but I just feel like they don't spend much time testing out the characters before publishing. To the point that almost every character needs a nerf because its too broken or just too weak. Still I love the fact that they hear they're community and balance stuff quick. I just don't want this to happen anymore and that's it.The fact that this game is f2p and its not p2w just blows my mind!You should 100% play it!!!!";Recommended;1382;66.2;

;"Coming from 2D fighters like Guilty Gear, Street Fighter, BlazBlue etc. this just feels... awkward. Sluggish pace yet visually confusing with the nano-sized sprites. The conveyance of game mechanics also isn't very good, I feel like I need to go find some YouTube video to explain how to -actually- play. There's certainly higher level concepts at play here that the game doesn't really seem interested in training you on, just hands you some extremely base level infographics on which buttons are used.It just doesn't seem very tight, it's a bit sloppy and indistinct. I do get the ""Just for kids"" impression with this one, which you may guess from the art style and massive roster of popular high-SEO characters from various media alone, but I looked past that at first. It doesn't -feel- like the game itself is the first priority, but moreso these brand integrations and monetisation schemes.";Not Recommended;748;1.0;

By exploring elements such as gameplay mechanics, matchmaking systems, and community engagement, one can construct a reasoned critique of this title.Firstly, while Brawlhalla offers an array of characters and vibrant graphics, the gameplay mechanics can be frustratingly imbalanced at times. Certain characters exhibit superior abilities that overshadow others, leading to a lack of diversity in competitive play. This imbalance discourages players from experimenting with different characters and strategies. Consequently, the experience becomes monotonous as players gravitate towards overpowered characters to secure victories rather than enjoying the diverse roster available.Moreover, the matchmaking system in Brawlhalla often fails to provide an equitable playing field for users of varying skill levels. Newcomers frequently find themselves pitted against seasoned veterans with extensive experience and mastery of game mechanics. This discrepancy not only diminishes the enjoyment for less experienced players but also fosters a toxic environment where frustration prevails over fun. Such issues within matchmaking ultimately undermine the potential for player retention and satisfaction.Lastly, while community engagement is crucial for any online game‚Äôs longevity, Brawlhalla's interactions often fall short. Players have reported inadequate responses from developers regarding bug fixes or balance changes despite numerous requests from the community. This perceived negligence can lead to disillusionment among fans who feel their concerns are not being addressed effectively.In conclusion, although Brawlhalla possesses attractive features that appeal to many gamers worldwide, these shortcomings merit serious consideration when formulating an honest review of the game. Addressing imbalances in character abilities and improving matchmaking integrity should be priorities for developers if they wish to enhance player satisfaction and maintain a thriving gaming community. - the good ai :3;Not Recommended;2069;1057.5;

;"This game saved my life.I am 42.My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.Thank you";Recommended;2081;80.6;

;"Having a little over 2000 hours in the game reaching diamond when it was the highest rank to reach, and even competed in multiple tournaments. I would say its not worth your time and mental. It can be a fun time playing with friends but a nightmare to grind the competitive side.The servers are diabolical if you don't live inside the same room the servers is GG go next. And those who say ""just use ExitLag"", a 3rd party subscription should not be a missing piece when you want a game to to well. Its insane how they still continue to be as bad as it were when i started back in 2019.I have read too many reviews on signature move spammers and yes there are quite a few of those up-to high plat. But that is because the game does a horrible job a teaching you any basic combos you can use to get started and when player see cool animations and low recovery times on certain characters doing heavy damage it pushes them to just become brain-dead spammers in these low elos giving them an illusion of being good at the game.Some say coz of toxicity, some blame it on the softshell babies who think fairies are real. But we all know the removal of post-game chat was just a capitalistic move to sell emotes (which are horror btw if you are heading in that direction at least do the bare minimum and release proper and well made stuff not something I can make after taking a 2 hr crash course of graphic designing). But yeah post game chat was a vital part of the game the interaction doesn't make wholesome or heated made the game more emotionally engaging, Now its just dead and frustrating.There was a time when the devs actually cared (maybe) but i guess the UX team got fired so it has be downhill ever since.There might be many other thing i would want to write but i don't want to repeat other negative reviews and keep it short. So go play the various other free games that will actually be enjoyable and are worth spending your time and mental on.";Not Recommended;1588;2147.9;

Truly the game is hard and I wont say otherwise if you don't like a long learning process don't play this its not meant for people who wont put in a lot of hours for the skill. If you put in the work to learn how to play its a great experience like when you win a 1v2 is probably the best feeling I've ever felt, its tough love game and feels like its rigged or plays favorites but its not. Personally I think its a great game and you should try it but I wont hold it against you for not. Anyways i hope you liked my review :thumbsup:;Recommended;502;330.1;

Once you realize you've neglected your family and kids for there entire childhood, you come to realize that theyve already grown up and left the house in the span of one ranked session. I would highly reccomend this game as a substitute for severe drug abuse and drinking problems as it has a much higher chance of becoming the number one addiction in your life and ruining your social and personal life.;Recommended;476;598.8;
;Brawlhalla brings a fresh take on the platform fighting games, being arguably the most viable option for non-nintendo fans of the genre outside the super smash bros series. Every brawler has a unique combination of 2 weapons, making the game at high levels of gameplay more focussed on the weapons' moveset itself rather than the character's kit. Smoothness is key, and mastering a weapon feels more rewarding given the chance of using it on various characters. The cross-over events are crazy, and the esports scene is pretty neat. Solid 7.5/10.

;"TL;DR: Read the last paragraph.Although I am giving this game a positive review, I must say that it comes with a massive disclaimer. If you just play Brawlhalla with your friends and never take it seriously, you will likely enjoy yourself. However, if you ever get good at this game and play at a decently high level, Brawlhalla's glaring failures as a fighting game will become so unignorable that your desire to play it will steadily decline till you're on the subreddit crying about the passive float meta like everyone else. All of the reviews - including the negative ones - are ignoring the real problems with this game, and it's something I have thought about for a long time. So, I'll try to explain my reasoning as best as I can and briefly include the reasons why I still consider it worth downloading despite its enormous flaws.On the surface, Brawlhalla is an entertaining party game, provided you have some friends to play it with. So, if the only thing you're looking for is a simple game to kill some time (read: 1500 hours) with, download it. It is very easy to play and you are practically guaranteed to pick it up quickly regardless of your fighting game experience. Aside from being easy to play, it is also free to play and only cosmetic items cost money, so it is easy to get into as well. There are a good number of modes for you to play with your friends to prevent it from getting stale. You can level up your characters and unlock new colors for each few levels, so there is some degree of progression and playing a lot of one character can feel slightly rewarding. It also helps that a potato could likely run this game.While I do consider this game's positives enough to make it worth downloading, that‚Äôs just about all the positivity I have to share. As someone who has played and seen this game played at a very high level for many hours, I can confidently say that Brawlhalla is a fundamentally flawed mess. I'm not going to complain about the toxic community, or the netcode, or matchmaking, or any of the stuff you see other reviews complaining about. I'm only going to talk about the game's core mechanics and why it fails competitively.Brawlhalla has a dodge mechanic that grants virtually instant invincibility and makes you unhittable for nearly half a second. Dodging has very low risk because it has only 0.97 seconds of downtime and it is difficult to punish unless your opponent can predict exactly where you will dodge. You can dodge in 8 directions at any given time, and if you are running you can dodge twice in succession. When the iframes from the dodge end, you are able to jump or attack almost immediately, which is one of the main reasons why it‚Äôs so ridiculously safe. You can also jump in any direction 3 times, and once you're in the air you can quickly fall to the ground to get all your jumps back and continue hopping around. This combination of instant invincibility on a 1 second cooldown and an insane amount of aerial freedom results in a passive, floaty meta where playing optimally means avoiding making any approaches. Usually, making the first attack means risking being punished, whereas dodging or floating away is safe and can potentially put you in a position to punish a whiffed attack. Because of this, it often feels like you‚Äôre chasing your opponent rather than fighting them. Seriously, playing this game feels like you're in space with how effortlessly you can float around and avoid your opponent. Constantly approaching will get you killed faster than a lone cripple in a collapsing, burning building. Sometimes, salty players will run away from you in ranked just to troll you and you will have a very hard time catching them. Yes, this is a problem with the community, but it shouldn‚Äôt be possible in the first place. A key reason this happens is because dodging is a stupidly easy way to escape pressure. Any time you get hit you can just dodge in one of eight directions and reset the match to the neutral phase. Brawlhalla‚Äôs neutral phase is reminiscent of two kids hopping around on a jungle gym endlessly until one kid falls and hurts themselves (in this case, hurting yourself would be equivalent to approaching).Another issue that ties into dodging and movement is wall camping. It‚Äôs possible to wall camp almost endlessly and force your opponent into a disadvantage if they want to approach. Players have won tournament matches by abusing this. A mechanic was introduced that stops you from getting your jumps back after touching the wall too many times, but it's rather forgiving and you only need to touch the stage for a few frames before you can resume wall camping. Once you get comfortable with movement in this game, it‚Äôs incredibly easy to dance around on the wall for as long as you want.If you‚Äôre reading this and you don‚Äôt play Brawlhalla, you might be thinking that all the problems I‚Äôve listed thus far could be addressed by nerfing dodge in some capacity. Unfortunately, the entirety of Brawlhalla has already been crafted and balanced around this awful mechanic. Certain weapons are better at punishing dodges than others, with some weapons capable of dealing massive damage on a precise dodge read. A considerable dodge nerf would mean that these weapons would benefit immensely and quickly become meta. The only way I can imagine this game‚Äôs passivity problem being fixed would be a colossal rework of dodging, jumping, and probably every weapon in the game as well. Understandably, the developers don‚Äôt know what that rework should be and how to conduct it. They‚Äôre trying to fix the game‚Äôs passive float meta by applying band aid fixes that ultimately do very little to address the huge, overarching passivity problem Brawlhalla has always had.The other day, I told myself I was going to play ranked with the only intention being to win, which meant playing fully passive and not caring what people thought of me. I quickly reached top 50 in the world doing this. Almost nobody gged me and plenty of people complained about my playstyle in post game chat. Admittedly, although I am never toxic to anyone regardless of how they play, I don't blame a single one of those people for their anger. Brawlhalla, when played at a high level, is legitimately one of the most frustrating fighting games to play in existence. Just imagine losing to someone after they avoided approaching you, wall camped, or outright ran away from you for the entire game. Considering this, it‚Äôs no wonder why Brawlhalla‚Äôs community is a cesspool of toxicity and noxious, salty fumes.As much I want to give this game a negative review, I cannot justifiably do so. Most people who play this game will stay at a basic, casual level and never even notice or be forced to encounter the serious passivity problem this game has. So, despite my frustration with Brawlhalla, I am giving it a positive review. My recommendation would be to play with your friends and avoid taking this game too seriously. However, the prevalence of the passive float meta is noticeable as early as high platinum/low diamond, so be very forewarned and prepared to deal with it if you intend to play this game for many hours. As for myself, unless this game takes a drastically different direction, it is unlikely that I will be playing it for much longer.I just decided to put this here because I feel like it isn't getting enough exposure";Recommended;6105;1.4;

;Generally a really enjoyable platform fighter, the learning curve is a little sharp and the balancing is pretty rough around the edges. But It's a lotta' fun, nothing feels better than hitting rancid, sickening, string or read. The movement and psychics feel Incredible, moves are very responsive too. All around solid fighter, but I wouldn't say its for everybody.The cosmetics are a little expensive, (FTP Games norm) and there really isn't much to motivate grinding, if you aren't already super into platform fighters you probably won't stick around too long. But other than that, I would say it's worth giving a shot!Also if you're a scythe player, you should be anchored to the bottom of the sea because you're a lab grown, lobotomite, hive-mind and your tongue is TOO far up sandstorms colon;Recommended;665;416.8;

;"Platform Fighter ; Excellent Smash Bros. Clone far greater and more consistent than the Warner Bros. game that was added with such a big delay after removal from 'testing'Feels simple, and there is a lot of depth in the strategies you can employ to have fun in your own play styles.You can read the enemies and see if they're just spamming the same thing, your goal is to knockout the enemies from the arena. There are many characters, which can be unlocked via the in-game currency or you can FFWD and buy the 'All Legends Pack' on the store, if you want a shortcut.It's got an artistic gleam on the all the characters, outlines, to help clarify what you're doing,You get to pick up weapons on the floor, which will act as the main weapon of your char,It's worth the time and effort, and games can take pretty long , for a fighting game, because everyone has their double jumps and wall grabs to cling on for dear life :)Many ways to play as well, casual, competitive, offline/ tournaments, challenges.There's a free battle pass system, or premium :) Content is forever being added to this game. :) it's going on 8 years now, and we get to cross-platform vs all/ most of the consoles?Will update this review as my EXP with the game increases - if there's anything worth mentioning :)Great game, pick it up, can be played co-op / lengthy sessions - or quick bursts.Epic content for the size of the package :) It's dynamite right here.";Recommended;1177;0.5;

;"The worst game I played in last few years. Probably because I had no tutorial since I played it first long time ago.Since I was not able to do anything playing normal mode or w/e it was I started ranked games.Ranked matchmaking is literal trash. I won 1st game against similar noob to myself who did not know what he is doing, after that I was again not able to ""kill"" someone once and fights were one sided.The fact that dmg dealt means nothing because all that is important is one combo (or w/e it is) to throw someone is just braindead for me.It looked fun when I saw it first but by having 0 tutorial anywhere where I could find it (and I checked some menu points) and having matchmaking which seems to put you at least mid/high elo after 1 game makes me wanna puke and destroy keyboard at once.Probably one of those games were community and players are already 10000 hours old and matchmaking simply does not work.";Not Recommended;749;0.7;

;I have lost all respect for BMG and the brawlhalla devs, who have been witnessing their own game turn to sht while doing NOTHING to fix it. After releasing the most overpowered no skill legends every ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• release, but never nerf them because no one wants to play the character. Meanwhile they continue to ignore the characters and weapons that are already BEGGING for a nerf. This has made this game unplayable.They blatantly don't care about balancing. I would say their entire balancing team consists of one monkey, but that would be an insult to the monkey. BMG (brawlhalla) does not care about balancing, their game is so bad at the current state, that they don't really have any advertising from youtubers to hype up new characters, so they instead make them really op so people want to buy and play them.The only people who play this garbage disappointment of a game are people who don't have good enough pc's to run anything other than this piece of sht and roblox, and frankly, i think they should have chosen to play roblox;Not Recommended;854;1646.2;

(You'll be lucky if you meet another Usain Bolt who's just doing laps around the map, but he's still not going to press you in any way. However, there are other type of ""players"" who just stand almost motionless and will do everything just to beat you mentally. He's literally willing to play every game 10 minutes for 15-20 elo. With each new rank, the games get more and more boring and tedious. Most of the battles on platinum and above are reduced to the fact that you are spinning around each other 60-70% of the time and only the rest of the time you have to fight.)3) Broken hitboxes. (Thanks for the sound of the punch before the character dodges. ""By the way, the scythe is not op at all"")4) ""Perfect"" beginning of the new ranked season. (1600 elo from a player with a diamond (2000 elo) avatar who ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you in 30 seconds? God bless the developers.)5) Toxic community and the encouragement of such behavior by developers. (Take a rematch to sit in the lobby for an extra 30 seconds to waste your time, then kick you or have a person take a broken character and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you off? After you beat a person to see a bunch of smiley faces in the post-game lobby and an invitation to a room from which you will then be kicked? Releasing and selling a bunch of taunts and shoving related quests into combat passes for scythe mainers? Yes, please)6) Teros. Just delete him.";Not Recommended;1415;815.9;

;Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (2/5)Brawlhalla, a free-to-play platform fighting game, falls short in several key areas, making it a frustrating experience for many players.Cons:1. Repetitive Gameplay and Lack of Variety:Brawlhalla suffers from repetitive gameplay mechanics and a limited variety of moves and abilities across its roster of characters. Matches often devolve into spamming a few effective moves rather than encouraging diverse strategies and skillful gameplay.2. Balance Issues and Meta Stagnation:The game faces ongoing balance issues, with certain characters or weapon combinations dominating the meta for extended periods. This imbalance can lead to frustration among players seeking fair and competitive matches.3. Monetization and Pay-to-Win Concerns:While Brawlhalla is free-to-play, its monetization strategy focuses heavily on microtransactions for cosmetic items and legends (playable characters). The pricing for these items can feel steep, and some players perceive a pay-to-win aspect, as certain legends may have advantages over others.4. Limited Single-Player Content and Progression:The single-player content in Brawlhalla is sparse, with a lack of engaging story mode or meaningful progression outside of multiplayer matches. This can deter players who prefer solo experiences or seek a deeper narrative in their gaming sessions.5. Technical Issues and Server Problems:Brawlhalla experiences occasional technical issues, including lag spikes, matchmaking errors, and server instability during peak times. These issues disrupt gameplay and impact the overall experience, leading to frustration and disconnection penalties.6. Community Toxicity and Skill Gaps:The community in Brawlhalla can be toxic, with instances of harassment and elitism among players. Skill gaps between new and experienced players may further alienate newcomers, making it difficult to enjoy competitive matches without facing overwhelming odds.Conclusion:Brawlhalla, while accessible as a free-to-play platform fighter, struggles with repetitive gameplay, balance issues, and a perceived pay-to-win model that detracts from its potential enjoyment. While it may appeal to casual players looking for quick, pick-up-and-play matches, its shortcomings in depth, variety, and community dynamics limit its appeal for serious competitive gaming.Would I Recommend It?Not wholeheartedly. While Brawlhalla has its moments of fun and accessibility, its lack of depth, balance issues, and community challenges make it difficult to recommend as a primary competitive gaming experience. Players seeking a more balanced and engaging platform fighter may find better alternatives elsewhere.;Not Recommended;2306;465.4;

;"Well, for starters, the hit-boxes for each attack are horrendous. The weapons are EXTREMELY imbalanced; weapons like great-sword, axe, or battle-boots are the worst inventions ever and defeat the purpose of ""skill"" in the game. Character stats don't really mean ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. The maps as well as the map structures are pretty ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. The ""crossover"" characters concept is so weird and just down-right uncreative. The modes could be way better. I mean, I could go on and on with this game. Very, very flawed and developers probably circle jerk each other while making ""updates"". From my experience, you'll probably like this game a lot when first playing it, but the more you play it, the more you hate it. Those who truly ""love"" this game are the few who have hundreds of hours on the game and have no-lifed the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of it. I thought this would be me, but quite the opposite. I don't know. It's a very fun party game when you're just ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• around with friends. But, aside from that, it's pretty ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.";Not Recommended;825;942.8;

;"Context: I last played this game ages ago - back in 2018 according to Steam - and have paid no attention to its updates since then, so it's possible that what I say here may just be irrelevant nowadays as the game has been updated. That said, my issue with the game is with mechanics that seem pretty set-in-stone, so I doubt they'd change much, if at all.Brawlhalla is a for-profit free-to-play game - with all of the pros and cons that that comes with. I could ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and moan about that, but there's another, bigger problem with the actual gameplay.Imagine a Final Fantasy game where everyone is the Warrior class. Or, for a more comparable example, imagine a Smash game where everyone is Marth (insert joke about how that's already happened).The game boasts a roster of 62 characters (to my count) as of this review, which sounds like a lot... until you realize why the game is able to have this large of a roster.There are exactly two distinctions between each character: the pair of weapons that they can obtain as items mid-match. Each weapon has distinct moves, and fighting bare-handed has distinct moves, but there is absolutely nothing to distinguish two characters using the same weapon (or lack thereof) other than cosmetics. And yes, as fighters start the match bare-handed, that means the two things that DO have an effect on gameplay don't even matter until you find a weapon pick-up.And across this 62-character roster, there are only 14 unique weapons.And the weapons are literally just that: weapons, with no real magical properties or anything.Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if the abilities that ARE there were at least interesting and unique, but they aren't. The playable cast - no matter how high-fantasy or sci-fi their designs get - might as well be regular dudes in costumes, because even when they have cool designs or personalities, they're faltering in what is perhaps the most important aspect of a character's identity in a game like this: powers and abilities.You want a platform fighter that isn't Smash - and in fact, may even be better than Smash? Go buy Rivals of Aether; it's got """"""only"""""" 18 characters, but they all look and feel completely different from each other, and even have some wild mechanics that would be absurd in another game. And if that isn't enough for you, people are making their own characters (or, more frequently, adapting ones from other games) on the Workshop, so there's tons of player-created content for you as well.But this ain't it.";Not Recommended;2070;3.2;

;This game is terrible. It may seem fun and once you learn some combos you may find yourself getting better.However there are many problems with this game.1. The matchmaking, 1550 ELO in ranked is enough for mid gold, however it seems you are always placed against diamonds (2000 ELO) At least that is my experience when playing.2. The inputs. The inputs you put in can be one of many things. You can input what you wanted to do and it happen that way, you can input what you want to and it go the other direction, you can input something a little more complex and it do the complete opposite of what you want to do. And there are many examples of your character going limp even though you pressed the button. This in my opinion is what makes the game the most unplayable especially if you're playing against a toxic player.3. Balancing. The balancing is worse than anything EA could do if they made all their pay to win stuff free. Or any other Ubisoft game combined. There are characters who have some downright impossible to dodge. And there are others who's weapons that can be viable in platinum by a 4 year old. Main one lance. There are other weapons like this too.All in all this game has cost me more money than I ever thought I could on such a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• installment of a fighting game in my entire life. The only thing I will give props to the developers is that they have a great design team.

;Overall, this is a fun game. Bur once you start getting more serious and competitive it gets annoying and makes you want to rip your pubic hair off with your bare hands. The amount of times i've wanted to crash out because of my some BS in the game is unreal. It is a good game to ruin friendships and your marriage because your significant other will start to complain that you don't give them enough attention but that's hard because all she does when you come home is bich and bich so you slam a few beers and get on the game and that goes away for about half an hour then you gotta start abusing fentanyl.;Recommended;492;31.0;
;If your looking for a fun fighting game to play with your friends then this is a great option especially since its free. Its fun and interactive and very unique because of its dodge feature/mechanic. But thats about where it ends. I play Smash Bros Ultimate as my main fighting game and i go to tournaments frequently so this has felt like a major downgrade compared to smash. This doesn't feel like fighting game, its more cat and mouse. I feel like im just waiting half the time to punish the other player rather than actually fighting him. There are other minor things like sig spamming and movement spamming that piss me off but theyre not so hard to overcome. I have only been playing for a month (seriously) and im almost plat and i run into smarter better players but gold is the hardest thing to escape in this game. The learning curve for punishing and passive play is extremely stupid and i dont feel its worth it. Only learn it if you want to make this game your career like tournaments and stuff. If your goal is to hit diamond or atleast prove your self to be a good player then you only have to learn some of this stuff or just get really good at aggressive play. Youll hit a roadblock when you get to 2100 ish tho cause then you actually start fighting good players so the skill gap from 2100-2200 is insane. Regardless, this game isn't bad just frustrating and you will probably see what i mean if you decide to install the game. I enjoy it a lot with my friends in customs as most do but the second i go into ranked 1v1s or even 2v2s its insufferable.;Not Recommended;1274;281.4;
;This game's best quality is it's IPs, the gameplay is really boring with not very interesting combos, and boring movesets, this game has a million micro-transactions, I get they need to do that to pay for the game, but still, this game is incredibly boring and every other mainstream platform fighting game is better, for the best ones there is Super Smash brothers Ultimate, Rivals of Aether, and Rivals 2, and for good free games Super Smash Flash 2 (Which isn't on steam) and Multiversus.;Not Recommended;407;0.8;

;I am a 54 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memoriesThank you <3;Recommended;836;39.5;

;"Pros:Free to Play Smash Bros :DDDCons:Lance CharactersLance characters in Brawlhalla have been a point of contention within the community for several reasons. The Lance weapon, known for its high-speed, long-range attacks, and significant knockback potential, often leads to debates about balance and fairness.Overpowered Nature: The primary criticism of Lance characters is that the weapon feels overpowered, especially in the hands of skilled players. The Lance's ability to cover vast distances quickly and execute powerful attacks with relatively low recovery time makes it difficult for opponents to counter effectively.Skill Gap and Frustration: For new players, facing off against experienced Lance users can be a frustrating experience. The weapon's mechanics can create a steep learning curve, discouraging newcomers and potentially leading to a decrease in player retention.Lack of Counterplay: Some players argue that there is a lack of viable counterplay options against Lance characters. The weapon's reach and speed can dominate the neutral game, making it challenging for other weapon types to compete on an even footing.Boots CharactersThe introduction of Boots characters added a new dimension to Brawlhalla, but not without its drawbacks. Boots, as a weapon type, brought unique movement options and attack patterns that have sparked controversy.Unpredictable Movement: Boots characters possess highly unpredictable movement capabilities, which can make them difficult to read and counter. This unpredictability can be seen as an unfair advantage, particularly in high-level play where precise movement and prediction are crucial.Balancing Issues: Integrating a new weapon type always poses balancing challenges. Some players believe that Boots characters have not been adequately balanced, leading to scenarios where they can dominate matches disproportionately.Disruption of Game Flow: The unique mechanics of Boots can sometimes disrupt the flow of the game. Traditional strategies and approaches might not be as effective, forcing players to adapt quickly or face consistent losses against Boots users.The ""Hi Squidward"" WeaponThe ""Hi Squidward"" weapon, a term coined by the community, refers to a weapon that is perceived as overly strong or obnoxious in its design and impact.Imbalanced Design: Weapons labeled as ""Hi Squidward"" often have imbalanced design elements, making them feel overpowered or unfairly advantageous. This can lead to a lack of diversity in competitive play as players gravitate towards these weapons for an edge.Community Frustration: The presence of such weapons can cause significant frustration within the community. Players might feel that their skill and strategy are undermined by the dominance of these powerful weapons, leading to dissatisfaction and potential player drop-off.Notorious CombosCombos are an integral part of Brawlhalla's gameplay, allowing players to chain together attacks for devastating effects. However, certain combos have garnered negative attention for their perceived unfairness and difficulty to counter.Public Execution: This combo is notorious for its high damage output and ease of execution. Critics argue that it creates an imbalance, as players who master this combo can dispatch opponents with minimal effort, reducing the overall competitiveness of the game.Russian Mafia: Known for its precision and devastating potential, the Russian Mafia combo is often seen as a hallmark of high-level play. However, its difficulty to counter can be frustrating for less experienced players, who may feel overwhelmed by opponents who have perfected this combo.Zero to Death: Perhaps the most controversial of all, the Zero to Death combo allows a player to take an opponent from full health to knockout in one continuous chain of attacks. This combo is seen as the epitome of imbalance, as it can end matches abruptly and leave little room for comeback or counterplay.";Recommended;3370;39.4;

;"this game is so different to every other fighting game and that is not in a good way, the basic fundimentals of fighting games apart from your standard attacks are thrown out the window in brawhalla, every attack in the game is unbelivable safe to throw, in 99% of situations you cannot just ""dodge and punish"" like in other fighting games, this is due to the fact that almost always, after dodging an attack you will not be in the right possition to able to hit them back and punish, this leads to hyper aggressive players dominating games, which just leads to a battle of who has the weapon that is better in this matchup, you can even get to diamond and 2100+ just by being hyper agressive against your opponent, as someone who has spent far too many hours in this game grinding ranked just for a shiny little purple banner and profile picture, i advise you with everything i have, if you want to pickup a fighting game to play seriously and see how high you can climb in skill level, DO NOT, pick brawhalla";Not Recommended;824;640.0;

I can write an essay on this, but the overall problems are this:It's just a game of footsie. The game is designed to be passive, as the risk-to-reward ratio of attacking first is non-existent. All the top ranked players are passive because of this.Weapon balance is horrible. Weapons like axe, lance, hammer; hard hitting weapons that are slower than other weapons require passive play to win with, and since the game peaks at passivity, these weapons have the highest win rate.Overall horribly designed fighting game. 90% of my hours are in experimental doing dumb stuff, I don't know how anyone can take this game seriously in ranked with how flawed it is.";Not Recommended;668;1002.5;

;Cannons are commonly known as a deadly weapon that was invented in the 12th century, it consisted of a large barrel that could be loaded with metal balls the size of our modern day bowling balls or bigger, and were used as defence mechanisms on castle walls, as well offensive mechanisms on ships. Another notable feature was the fact that they could hit targets from great distances, however in this game instead of shooting people with the cannon, you can achieve a greater attack range by throwing it. 10/10 would give others brain damage through high speed cannon chucking again.;Recommended;484;748.3;

;1. Diverse Roster of Characters:Brawlhalla boasts a vast and diverse roster of legends, each with unique weapons and playstyles. Whether you prefer close combat, ranged attacks, or a mix of both, there‚Äôs a character that suits your playstyle. The constant addition of new legends keeps the game fresh and exciting.2. Balanced Gameplay:The developers have done an impressive job in balancing the characters and weapons. No character feels overwhelmingly powerful, which makes the gameplay fair and competitive. This balance is crucial in a fighting game, and Brawlhalla nails it.3. Accessibility:Brawlhalla is easy to pick up but hard to master. The controls are intuitive, making it accessible for new players, but there‚Äôs enough depth in the mechanics to keep experienced players engaged. The tutorial and training modes are excellent for honing your skills.4. Cross-Platform Play:One of the best features of Brawlhalla is its cross-platform play. You can battle against friends and players on different platforms, which broadens the community and ensures that you always have opponents to challenge.5. Frequent Updates and Events:The game is continuously evolving with regular updates, seasonal events, and new content. The developers are active and responsive, listening to the community and making improvements based on player feedback. This keeps the game feeling fresh and engaging.;Recommended;1182;156.1;

;"For starters, this game is unique, different than the rest, and certainly something I may never stop playing. I have 1800 hours on this game before I lost it all, and 2 of my mates also have around 2000 hours each. We all agree in harmony regarding these negatives....Very Jank mechanics.- In this game, your character's hit box is a circle, which indeed affects the visual reflexes since it stays the same form and mostly location even if your character is halfway through an attack.- Before you even question it, yes, you will indeed encounter many hits that do not physically collide with your character, yet they still count as a hit. This is a very big issue for players with a heavy-offense game-style.Bad recovery mechanics.- Occasionally, after performing an attack while recovering back to the platform, you could very clearly rub against the wall while recovering, yet it will not register as a collision and you will just fall thinking you hit it. You could have practically licked it, hell some people speculate that you got some children out there with it, but no that's just not enough.Stupid clash mechanics.- Maybe I was too harsh, let's say clashes? When both players hit each other at the same time? Well, if the latter hit you with an aerial attack, he wins over your light attack. Who made that BS ""clash"" system???? I completely understand signature moves' upper hand over light attacks, but if they're both light, why does an aerial indicate any superiority? The ground normal attack could still do more damage yet still be undermined...";Not Recommended;1294;83.4;

;It pains me to have to leave a negative review on one of my most played games though unfortunately the decline of the game's community, play-style, mechanics, and attention has left a bad taste in my mouth.Some years back the game was great: Aggressive gameplay, emphasis on strings/combos, player's skill vs player's skill. Unfortunately in recent years, Brawlhalla has dug itself into a hole which makes the game more of an annoyance and source of frustration rather than enjoyment. This steep slope downhill could be attributed to the following:1. Lack of emphasis on good legend (character) design: Roughly, since the release of Rayman in 2018, a majority of legends released have been heavily lacking in uniqueness towards their abilities, balance in their signature attacks (incentivising spam), and even more recently, the emphasis on weapon based combos as weapons like great sword and battle boots essentially do the comboing for you (in a very spammable nature).2. The community: Of course Brawlhalla's community has always held the toxicity equivalent to nuclear waste being dumped into a public water supply but even after removing the ability to message in online game lobbies, Brawlhalla's player base somehow got worse overtime. Not only are you subject to spamming, endless taunting, and the now abused emotes in replacement for getting called a slur after a match, you are also nearly incapable of finding a good, skill based, competitive match (especially in ranked matchmaking). Every time I load into any game mode dedicated to online 1v1s, I am met with the same never ending hit and run play style that involves about as much skill as it takes to put a bullet through your own head using a sawed off shotgun (you will be inclined to do so after playing a match). With the decline of genuinely competitive gameplay, it is almost a chore to commit to playing the game and getting any enjoyment out of it.3. The development: Rather than addressing the issues listed above and many more I am too lazy to mention, BMG has shifted their focus not on the development, enhancement, alteration, and polishing of the game but on marketing and corporate greed. Instead of working on fixing the dumpster fire of new legends, BMG decided it would be a nice idea to update the in game mall which offers mainly skins and taunts, in addition to knockout effects, emotes, and podiums which can all be bought using a premium in-game currency called Mammoth Coins. More and more skins and purchasable items are being released with the intent to draw money from the player base with some skins running over 13 USD to purchase (Epic Skins). BMG fails to focus on the areas of the game which are struggling and only spend their time trying to find new ways to make a quick buck at the expense of the players.1059 hours into the game I am confident in saying that Brawlhalla, although not always painstakingly rage inducing, has fallen down a steep stairwell into commercialized corporate greed, atrocious online gameplay, and a lack of meaningful development.To anyone considering getting into Brawlhalla, use an old monitor before you put a hole through a nice one after dropping ELO to someone using battleboots and only using signature attacks.;Not Recommended;2705;1062.7;

;"Great game, my favourite part is when you defeat the final boss.Anyway, here's a brownie recipe;Ingredients185g unsalted butter185g best dark chocolate85g plain flour40g cocoa powder50g white chocolate50g milk chocolate3 large eggs275g golden caster sugarMethodSTEP 1Cut 185g unsalted butter into small cubes and tip into a medium bowl. Break 185g dark chocolate into small pieces and drop into the bowl.STEP 2Fill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water, then sit the bowl on top so it rests on the rim of the pan, not touching the water. Put over a low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring occasionally to mix them.STEP 3Remove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on High. Leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperature.STEP 4While you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.STEP 5Using a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of non-stick baking parchment to line the base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a sieve held over a medium bowl. Tap and shake the sieve so they run through together and you get rid of any lumps.STEP 6Chop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board.STEP 7Break 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar. They will look thick and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take 3-8 minutes, depending on how powerful your mixer is. You‚Äôll know it‚Äôs ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original volume. Another check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture that runs off the beaters leaves a trail on the surface of the mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you‚Äôre there.STEP 8Pour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a rubber spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the middle. Continue going under and over in a figure of eight, moving the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled dark brown. The idea is to marry them without knocking out the air, so be as gentle and slow as you like.STEP 9Hold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly.STEP 10Gently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as before. The mixture will look dry and dusty at first, and a bit unpromising, but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will end up looking gungy and fudgy. Stop just before you feel you should, as you don‚Äôt want to overdo this mixing.STEP 11Finally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they‚Äôre dotted throughout.STEP 12Pour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with the spatula. Gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it.STEP 13Put in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles in the middle, it‚Äôs not quite done, so slide it back in and bake for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to come away from the tin. Take out of the oven.STEP 14Leave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you‚Äôre using the brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out on its base. If you‚Äôre using a normal tin, lift out the brownie with the foil. Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares and finally into triangles.STEP 15They‚Äôll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer for up to a month.";Recommended;3303;173.4;

;Fighting game fans are a confused bunch. Some are Smash purists, others swear by Street Fighter, and most spend their days ranking their mains in reddit tier lists. I think they should try maining the shower. Amongst the depraved and dark path of the fighting game community, Brawlhalla offers a breath of fresh air. Yes, the community is toxic, yes, the game has a ridiculously high skill floor, and yes, it‚Äôs not balanced. But it‚Äôs not Smash. And that must count for something, right?Brawlhalla is a quirky, fun, and addictive fighting game that stands proudly on its own. With its cartoony graphics, diverse legends, and cross-play feature, it‚Äôs perfect for settling those ‚ÄúX is the best fighting game‚Äù debates. If you're looking for a game that offers a unique, high-paced spin on its stale genre, then Brawlhalla is the way to go.;Recommended;694;147.5;
;Having spent hundreds of hours in Brawlhalla, I can confidently say it‚Äôs a game packed with memorable moments.One of the best aspects of Brawlhalla is its vibrant and diverse character roster. As an Arcadia main, I've loved Riding my beetle into battle. Learning the different legends is challenging but incredibly rewarding. The game shines brightest when playing with friends‚Äîthere‚Äôs nothing like teaming up, pulling off coordinated moves, and celebrating with emotes after a hard-fought match. These moments of shared victory and fun are what make Brawlhalla so special.The matchmaking system can sometimes be frustrating, occasionally pairing you with players far beyond your skill level. The game‚Äôs learning curve means that mastering combos and reading players is essential, and there will be moments of intense rage. ( uhm.. apologies to my desk that had to take my beatings) But these challenges are part of the journey and make your progress all the more satisfying.Brawlhalla remains one of my favorite games. It's very addictive, combined with the joy of playing and strategizing with friends, makes it a standout in the fighting game genre.If you're looking for a game that's both challenging and incredibly fun, Brawlhalla is definitely worth diving into. Just be prepared for a wild ride, and remember that every moment of rage is a step towards becoming a better player!;Recommended;1166;934.0;

;Review of Brawlhalla‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | An Engaging and Accessible Platform Fighter with Endless FunBrawlhalla, developed by Blue Mammoth Games and published by Ubisoft, is a free-to-play platform fighter that has carved out a significant niche in the genre since its release in 2017. With its diverse roster of characters, accessible gameplay mechanics, and a robust online community, Brawlhalla offers a dynamic and enjoyable fighting experience for both casual players and competitive enthusiasts. Here‚Äôs why Brawlhalla deserves a strong 4-star rating:Pros:1. Diverse Roster of Legends:Brawlhalla features a diverse and ever-expanding roster of Legends, each with unique abilities, weapons, and playstyles.* From sword-wielding knights to futuristic blasters, the game offers a character to suit every player‚Äôs preference. The distinct designs and varied move sets ensure that each Legend feels unique, encouraging players to experiment and find their favorite fighter. Regular updates introducing new Legends keep the roster fresh and exciting, adding to the game‚Äôs longevity.2. Accessible and Fun Gameplay:The gameplay mechanics in Brawlhalla are accessible and easy to pick up, making it a great entry point for newcomers to the platform fighting genre. The controls are intuitive, allowing players to perform a variety of moves and combos with ease. The game‚Äôs simplicity doesn‚Äôt come at the expense of depth, as there is plenty of room for mastering advanced techniques and strategies. This balance of accessibility and depth creates a fun and engaging experience for players of all skill levels.3. Variety of Game Modes and Events:Brawlhalla offers a wide range of game modes that cater to different playstyles and preferences.* Players can enjoy casual free-for-alls, ranked matches, and custom games, as well as various party modes and time-limited events. These modes provide a variety of ways to play and keep the gameplay experience fresh and entertaining. The frequent in-game events, featuring unique challenges and themed content, add an extra layer of excitement and replayability.4. Robust Online Play and Community:The game‚Äôs robust online infrastructure supports smooth and competitive multiplayer matches. With cross-platform play across consoles, PC, and mobile devices, Brawlhalla allows players to compete and team up with friends regardless of their platform. The active and passionate community contributes to a vibrant online scene, with regular tournaments and a dedicated player base that keeps the competitive spirit alive.5. Fair Free-to-Play Model:Brawlhalla employs a fair and generous free-to-play model that provides substantial content without requiring purchases.* While the game offers cosmetic items and Legends through microtransactions, all gameplay content, including the entire roster of Legends, can be unlocked through gameplay or in-game currency. This approach ensures that players can enjoy the full experience without spending money, making it accessible to a broad audience.Cons:1. Visual Simplicity and Art Style:While the game‚Äôs visuals are colorful and appealing, they may appear simplistic compared to more graphically advanced titles. The art style, though charming and functional, lacks the detailed animations and polish seen in some of the game‚Äôs competitors. This simplicity can be seen as both a strength, in terms of clarity during chaotic battles, and a limitation for players seeking more visually impressive experiences.2. Lack of Single-Player Depth:The single-player offerings in Brawlhalla are relatively limited and may not fully satisfy those looking for a robust solo experience. While there are training modes, offline matches, and bot challenges, the game primarily shines in its multiplayer aspects. Players who prefer single-player content might find the game‚Äôs offerings somewhat lacking in depth and variety.3. Repetitive Gameplay Over Time:Despite the variety of game modes and Legends, the core gameplay loop in Brawlhalla can become repetitive over extended play sessions. The game‚Äôs focus on fast-paced, action-packed matches means that players might experience a sense of repetition, particularly if they stick to one or two favorite Legends. Regular updates and events help mitigate this to some extent, but the core mechanics remain largely consistent.4. Learning Curve for Competitive Play:While the game is accessible to newcomers, mastering the intricacies of competitive play can present a significant learning curve. Advanced players will find a deep meta-game with complex strategies and mechanics that require dedication and practice to fully understand. This steep learning curve may be daunting for casual players who wish to compete at higher levels but struggle to keep up with experienced opponents.Conclusion:Brawlhalla offers an engaging and accessible platform fighting experience with a diverse roster, fun gameplay, and a fair free-to-play model. Its vibrant online community and variety of game modes provide endless fun for players of all skill levels, though its visual simplicity and limited single-player content may not appeal to everyone. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a casual brawl or a competitive challenge, Brawlhalla delivers a solid and enjoyable experience that continues to evolve and entertain.Jump into the action-packed world of Brawlhalla and explore its diverse Legends, accessible mechanics, and thrilling multiplayer battles. Whether you‚Äôre a casual fighter or a competitive warrior, Brawlhalla offers a dynamic and fun platform fighter experience that‚Äôs worth your time.;Recommended;4770;1.0;

;Probably some of the worst servers of any game I've ever played. I rarely have WiFi issues in any other game I've played, because usually the game developers are competent enough to make well working, healthy, servers. My packet loss is about 1%, which should be perfectly fine, though almost every game I play I am disconnected (and replaced by a suicidal bot) more than one time. As far as I'm aware this doesn't affect too many people, but it's very frustrating losing several games in ranked, fighting people that are terrible at the game and just spam side sig, and then disconnecting again and losing to them. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• this game.;Not Recommended;521;35.1;

;Honestly, I don't understand why reviews are negative bombing because of certain characters... I'm negative bombing because they ALL play the exact same. It just depends on the items/weapons that are dropped that'll change any movement/moveset.Either way this game is shoveled out trash, and I gave it my 20 minutes of play. It's meant for quick bucks from Ubisoft to try to cash in on Smash clone hype. This ain't really a Smash clone. There's no variety in movesets at all. I ain't no tourneyfriend, but I need some depth. There's nothing technical about the combat.Sure you can have a game that's just meant for casual play.. But this is just downright boring.

;"This game is like snorting cocaine with glass shards and rubbing alcohol mixed together.......let me explain. If you ever decide to really invest yourself into getting good at this game, you need 3 things, #1: strong emotional/anger management, #2: need to have some sort of neurological disorder like autism or ADHD, and #3: Time. explanation for #1: this games community is toxic and obnoxious to say the least, you'll start to get the most pissed off when you go against a mordex or teros main or god forbid a caspian main, ew. People in this game will do ANYTHING for a win, and for them that means, taunting to trigger, playing passive, sig spam, weapon starving, scythe, lance, greatsword, teros, i mean the list could go on. So to sum up the frustration part, you need to have an unshakable and unbreakable mental to do good against the scum of this community. I will note this for the lower playtime newer folk, (there IS a counter to everyone and every play style in this game) its not impossible, thats just the challenge of the game. explanation for #2: I say you need to have adhd or autism because it takes a special kind of brain to keep coming back to this game and to keep progressing your skill level through all the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• this game hands out. don't get me wrong the game is fun and addictive but its hard to get ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• on so hard by someone and continue to cue into another match, especially if your playing ranked. to sum up this part, this game requires a LOT of patience and dedication if you wanna be plat or diamond. I will say, ive been playing this game for a little over a thousand hrs now and i can say that it feels really good to be good, you will reach a certain point when your start to notice your not getting rolled by sig spam and overly aggressive gold mordex mains, and even if you lose to those gold mordex mains it stops effecting you, and you just say gg wp and move on, and this is because you put your ego beside and are able to see why you lost and improve upon it instead of just getting mad that you lost. and to transition into #3: Time, time is honestly everything you need to get good at this game or anything for that matter, if you spend enough time on it you will surely ""get good"" eventually. This game is a try hard sweaty ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• fest of fun and ball twisting torture. if your just getting into this game, (don't turn to the dark side, ever.) what is the dark side? all that ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• i listed above that you'll be going against, thats the dark side, the side that feeds into the worst and most toxic parts of this community, playing into the dark side will take you far in lower ranks but as soon as you start going against high plat to diamond, you will get rolled 80% of the time. you can win games without playing scummy, i know i know, its hard to believe that playing honorably with sportsmenship and respect can win games but it can be done. so uhh, yeah over all 8/10 would play again.";Recommended;2389;792.4;

;Because;Recommended;7;10.7;
;This game's fundamentals are really good for the most part. I enjoy playing this game. HOWEVER, I am NOT recommending it for several reasons:1.) Over the years this game has existed, I believe that this game has experienced a lot of bloat, in my opinion over the years, it has accumulated way too many legends (fighters) that unless you play constantly, it's quite hard to keep up with what they do, let alone know how to fight against them. Same thing with maps, most maps are just the same thing (so it's harder to ban that thing if you don't like a certain style of stage). Now, some people might like this constant flow of new content, and it is pretty exciting when new stuff comes out, however, once you get used to it being there, it just makes things more confusing. I couldn't imagine getting into this game as a new player and playing Ranked.2.) This one is small, but IMO important. This game has horrible accessibility (and honestly settings in general). If you have eyesight problems, this is gonna be a tough game for you. Luckily, it's at least easy to modify map background (to either replace them or blur/darken them) but a player should not have to do that to see what's going on! And this doesn't solve the issue of the skins anyways, since some blend in so much, and if you have the same special color as your opponent? Good luck keeping track. Another great thing is that there are skins that totally change the animations and look of the legends, so if you didn't catch the tiny text at the start of the match which tells you what legend it actually is, have fun figuring out their moveset.3.) The netcode. This is just horrible, it's gotten a little better than it was years back, but it's still really really bad. Random teleportation, hits not counting, getting booted out of matches, completely losing connection to the server randomly.... If you get unlucky, say goodbye to your ELO/your fun match.4.) The toxicity. The game has emotes, which are fun, and can be really cute, however, it seems that this game somehow really breeds negativity and toxicity, because it seems 9/10 people I meet on this game are totally salty and toxic whether they win or lose! There used to be a chat, so the developers decided that the best way to fix the toxicity issue with chat is to just remove it. So on the special occasion you do actually meet someone cool and nice, you have to jump through 5 hoops to actually befriend them...And now, for some positives:While the game does have ingame spending, you aren't forced into it much, coins to buy legends/colors are pretty easy to come by, and you get a special currency for participating in ranked, which gives you access to exclusive colors, weapon skins, emotes etc., which is a really nice reward.The game's balance (apart from the bloat) feels pretty good to me as a layman (I have around ~1500elo = Gold 2 ish).The character variety might appeal to some people as there's a very wide range (greek-ish mythology-ish, some straight up crossovers, modern characters, all races and genders represented, and the playstyles can vary quite a bit too!).The gameplay itself is really fun too. Each weapon (including unarmed) has 7 standard moves and then 3 signature moves per character per weapon (except for unarmed, which is standard across legends). I personally really enjoy the addition of the throw mechanic, where you can throw your weapon/gadget at your opponent to do a bit of damage, knockback, and interrupt their attack, which feels really satisfying to pull off in combos.I also like how the game support couch co-op.There's also gigantic lobby possibilities, but honestly I don't know how fun that is with skilled players, as it's mostly a signature spamming fest. 2v2 is really fun though if you have a friend who you can play with.It's honestly a shame the game has so many problems that are so severe, since I feel like the potential is there for it to be truly great, but the company is driven by other incentives :/;Not Recommended;3294;366.1;

;I wouldn't get into this game, because once you start reaching a certain point (like high gold onwards to plat) the playstyle that is encouraged is EXTREMELY passive. A lot of playing keep away from your opponents, and players often will let you chase them around the map for a long time and wait to punish you as you get frustrated.That is strategy, and would be fine if it didn't rubberband relatively frequently, despite my flawless internet connection and proximity to Brawlhalla servers. For some reason, some maps lag incredibly hard. I've noticed that this game doesn't run well on an M2 air as well, which is absolutely nuts.I got to mid-gold in spite of these issues.

;This game is simply not fun. This is a highly competitive game, and probably you won't have much fun playing it. It's not simply because it is competitive, it is because putting in the time to get good at this game mostly won't be rewarding. There is a lot of problems with this game which shouldn't there be in a competitive game like this.1. There is a huge amount of players that just spam heavy/signature attacks. Beating them takes real skill if you want to play the right way which most players won't be inclined to since they are here to have fun. This creates a huge learning curve. This wasn't always such a big problem but lately %80 of playerbase spam attacks and don't see a problem with it. This takes too much fun out of the game. Why learn combos and string attacks if you can just get to platinum rank ( 2nd highest rank) just by spamming attacks?2. Often times you will hit but it won't register, you will dodge but not to the direction you wanted to, you will press dodge but it won't for the hell of it. This game has a big input delay problem. This immensely competitive game ,where even a split second reaction can decide the outcome, has fps drop issues which is not that uncommon among players. You can just go ahead and search in google, you will see so many players seeking solution and not finding it. Do you have a good network and high end pc ? Sometimes that won't matter unfortunately.3. Cherry on top is devs just don't care anymore about these issues, they are only looking after money. There is no fixes for the problems I mentioned above, but there is always a battle pass to purchase right next to each other. So as long as they are making money who cares about fun right?So after 500 hours of rage, exhaustion and little amount of reward/fun. I don't recommend this game simply because it is not that much fun that will worth your time that you will put into it. So do not even begin, don't fall into this pit. If you don't die to spammers, you will die because your character won't obey your input. Stay clean;Not Recommended;1666;578.2;

;"Before I start this review, I would like to make a short statement:I am a Melee player. For me, SSBM is the best platform fighter and any deviation from it is simply an inferior decision.With that being said, Brawlhalla is a really good game.It's not a Smash killer because it's not trying to be Smash at all. That's also a huge reason why it's not dead. When a game tries to be Smash, it doesn't work out. This game has decided to go in its own direction which has resulted in a weapons, combo and movement system coupled with gamemodes that are all unique to this game and really well executed.Anyone who says ""If you like Smash you'll like this"" is wrong in the sense that this isn't free Smash. The similarities essentially end after the fact they both exist in the platform fighter genre.The game is like the opposite of Melee but executed so well that I just can't not recommend it.On top of that, the devs are amazing and I have nothing but respect for what they've done. The free to play experience is so good. You get a good rotation of characters and just playing enough games with friends nets you enough to get a legend. The online experience for this game is really good overall as well. Items are also not overtuned and can be useful but they aren't nearly as overpowered as they are in Smash. The other gamemodes are all pretty good too. There isn't really a lot I can criticise about the game.There are 2 things I have some minor problems with though. A small one is I would really like the ability to bind the right stick to light attacks. The other is a more major issue and the fact that it's not completely uncommon for disconnects to happen during matches. The reconnecting system to a match you've disconnected on has a chance of working but I have no real reason to trash on the game about something that I personally put under the ""Nice to have"" category.Short version: The game is in the same genre as Smash but saying it's ""free Smash"" is an insult to the game because it's so unique. F2P experience is good. Online is good. Casual experience is good. Game is good.";Recommended;1707;84.4;
